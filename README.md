# Data Anonymization Tool

* What does this project do? **TODO**

In this project, we envision a tool that could help users manage voice data responsibly. A user can use it to identify parts of the speech that are privacy related and take actions to anonymize them. Some potential features we have brainstormed include allowing users to define different levels of privacy concerns and label data accordingly, editing features that enable users to cut or mask sensitive information, or implementing voice changing features that could modify the speaker acoustic attributes to make it unrecognizable.

* Short motivation for the project? (Don't be too long winded)

January first of 2020 was also the date when California Consumer Privacy Act took effect. This is a significant milestone for privacy protection. California was the first state in US to enact such a law. Many observers believe it will set an example for other states to follow, which will lead to some actions at the federal level. In Europe, there is a similar law called General Data Protection Regulation that has taken effect on May 25, 2018. These two laws make impossible for successful business not to think about the complex legal and practical context in which they deal with user information. While both laws lend much focus on how to obtain and manage consents, in real life privacy decisions are often decisions on trade-offs. How much risk do I get myself into by sharing my information? What can I get out of by sharing my information? How a company handles your data can persuade you to share more or less about yourself. So, being able to anonymize data properly will become a critical requirement.

Anonymizing data is not as simple as it may sound. Even with text-based data, we need to think about identifiable information, such as one’s name, gender, address, phone number, but also sensitive information, such as one’s religious belief or political affiliation. And there are also tricky details, such as a unique experience, that could reveal one’s identity to some people. With the success of a lot IoT devices,we now face greater challenges with audio, video, or biometric data.
