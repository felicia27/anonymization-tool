                            What is demanded, then, is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era
                            of responsibility -- a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to
                            ourselves, our nation and the world; duties that we do not grudgingly accept, but rather
                            seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so
                            defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task.

                            So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the
                            year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying
                            campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing.
                            The snow was stained with blood. At the moment when the outcome of our revolution was most
                            in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words to be read to the people:

                            "Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, <span class="coded">when
                                nothing but hope and virtue could survive... that the city and the country,</span>
                            alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." </div>

                            America: In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember
                            these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and
                            endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were
                            tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and
                            with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of
                            freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
